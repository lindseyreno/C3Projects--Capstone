### Week One Recap 10/5 - 10/9

#### Work Completed This Week  

  This week I did a lot of research into which RSS feeds I want to use and what information I can get from each one.  I decided I wanted to make this a Rails app using Postgres and started looking at what gems might be helpful.  I also started reading a lot about natural language processing and machine learning in order to put each event into a category and also provide personalized suggestions to users.  I also put together my product plan.  I'm still in the process of transferring my notes to my trello board.

#### Plan for Next Week

  Next week I will be focusing on getting my rails app and database set up, assigning categories to the data from an RSS feed possibly using natural language processing and saving the events to the database.  I also want to set up getting and saving updates and new events from that RSS feed as a background job probably using Sidekiq.  Getting all this set up for a single source will be the goal but I hope to have this set up for other sources as well.
