# Product Plan

### Problem Statement  

  What events are happening in Seattle?  Sometimes it feels like it is hard to find out what is going on around the city without going to multiple sources or signing up for several email newsletters and still end up finding out about an event or remember one you forgot a few days after it happens.  

### Product Description

  This application will focus on finding and making available to its users events in Seattle and the surrounding area and having fewer emails filling up their inbox.  Although large, popular events will be present, this application will also focus on finding smaller community events that often go unnoticed.  Users will be able to search and select events and categories of events they want to have in an email newsletter with suggestions based on their preferences.  The user will be able to determine how often they get these emails.  Users will also be able to sign up for specific alerts or reminders of events they want to attend.  

### Market Research  

  [Eventful](http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/events)  
  This site is probably the most similar to what I am proposing to make.  It has many of the same features, alerts and customizations, but it tracks events for multiple cities and is not as focused on Seattle.  Events in Seattle parks or local council meetings are not typically on Eventful.

  [Visit Seattle](http://www.visitseattle.org/events/)  
  This site lets users search local events and subscribe to an email newsletter however it does not appear to allow the user to customize the content of the newsletter.

  [Seattle.gov](http://www.seattle.gov/living-in-seattle/event-calendar)  
  This has local Seattle events but allows only a daily email, iCalendar or RSS/Atom feed subscriptions.  This same format is true for all seattle.gov calendars.

  [Seattle Weekly](http://www.seattleweekly.com/calendar/)  
  This site has an event calendar and a user can sign up to add events to calendars they already are using but the scope of events is also limited.

  [Best Events for 12 Months](http://www.events12.com/seattle/october/)  
  This site doesn't have a subscription service meaning that a user has to go to the site each time they want to find out about events.  It also has a visual style that appears old and not user friendly.

  There are also applications for individual venues or groups, such as STG Presents, that focus on specific types of events such as the theater.  Some of these sites also have email newsletters but most people have multiple areas of interest or attend events at multiple venues which means signing up for more than one newsletter.  Newspapers and magazines, most with an online presence as well, have event calendars or recommended events but lack the scope and personalization that this application intends to address.

### User Personas

  The user of this application is someone who lives in Seattle and wants a personalized and easy way to get information without having to put forth a lot of effort or time.  This user doesn't want to sign up for an email newsletter for each area they want event information about.  They also do not want to have to continuously check multiple websites to make sure they don't miss an event that is important to them.  The user wants to be able to control the number of emails they get on this topic by determining how often they get them and also have the ability to personalize the content of that email to reflect only what they want to see.
